# Autonomous-Drone-Navigation

## In this repository, I try to find a solution for Autonomous Quadrotor Navigation 
This solution based on TSP (Travel Salesman Problem) and Visual Servoing approaches. For this reson the repository includes scripts of these aproaches.
Main requirement of the scripts are global points (x,y,z,yaw) in a list. The path planning aproach will handle by TSP up to 11 points in global cordinates. The Visual Servoing handle by very cheap cost way of Pose Oriented aproach of Visual Servoing
